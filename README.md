# Project Name: JLBackdor

A Python-based system automation tool that helps in managing startup applications and executing tasks remotely in a secure and controlled manner. The tool is designed for use by system administrators and developers to automate certain system-level processes.

---

## Features

- **Automatic Startup Integration**: The application automatically copies itself to the startup folder upon execution, ensuring that it runs whenever the system starts. This feature is useful for persistent applications like monitoring tools or system management utilities.
  
- **Server Communication**: The application sends a request to a designated server, waiting for further instructions. Upon receiving the instructions from the server, it performs the required tasks, making it a useful tool for remote management.
  
- **Task Execution**: The application executes tasks on the local system based on server commands. These tasks are predefined by the server, ensuring that only authorized and validated commands are executed on the system.

- **Security Focused**: The tool does not introduce any known vulnerabilities. It relies on secure server communication, performs only authorized actions, and ensures that no harmful or unauthorized software is downloaded or executed.

## Usage

### Running the Application

To run the tool, execute the following command:

```bash
python server.py
python app.py
```

What the Tool Does
Upon execution, the tool automatically copies itself to the startup folder, ensuring that it starts with the system.
It then establishes a connection with the remote server and waits for instructions.
The server sends back specific tasks, such as downloading files, executing commands, or other administrative actions.
The tool performs these tasks securely and responsibly, ensuring that no unauthorized activities take place.
Security Considerations
This tool is designed with security in mind:

All server communications are encrypted.
The tool does not perform any harmful actions or introduce vulnerabilities.
The only operations performed are those explicitly defined and authorized by the server.
It is important to use this tool only in environments where you have permission to manage systems remotely.
